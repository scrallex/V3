Multi-Strand Bundle Analytics for FX Regime Allocation
Sep Dynamics Research
18 November 2025
Abstract
We revisit Sep Dynamics’ structural manifold program using five years (13 Nov 2020–
14 Nov 2025) of OANDA FX data to determine whether multi-strand bundles provide a
reproducible trading edge. Every gate emitted by the manifold retains instantaneous and
forward rate-of-change (ROC) labels for seven horizons (5–360 minutes) plus structural
telemetry (coherence, hazard, entropy, slopes, semantics). Building on this instrumentation
we:
1. construct auditable strand bundles via co-activation clustering to promote mean-revert
opportunities, fade neutral deterioration, and quarantine chaotic structure;
2. evaluate those bundles with a 26-week train / 4-week test walk-forward spanning 258
folds, incorporating 1.2 pip transaction-cost assumptions and explicit cross-validation
to reduce look-ahead and overfitting risks; and
3. translate bundle activations into simulated trades (855k positions) to measure ex-
pectancy after costs, drawdowns, win rate dispersion, and regime stability.
Backtests suggest a persistent edge: the combined bundle book earns +5 .99 bp per four-week
test fold (aggregate +18 .7M bp) and +24 .35 bp per simulated trade after costs, yet we em-
phasise that live performance may vary because FX liquidity, spreads, and macro shocks can
deviate from historical norms. All code ( runweekly rocbackfill.py ,build strand bundles.py ,
walkforward bundle backtest.py ,bundle activation simulator.py ) and datasets live
in the public research repo so that diligence teams can reproduce every result.
1 Introduction
Macroeconomic cycles routinely flip FX pairs between mean-reverting, neutral, and chaotic
regimes, complicating systematic allocation. Early versions of SEP’s structural manifold quan-
tified single strands of behaviour but lacked a cohesive playbook for combining them into trade-
able baskets. This paper documents the evolved approach: multi-strand bundles that (i) remain
interpretable, (ii) earn positive expectancy after realistic costs, and (iii) publish the guardrails
needed for risk and operations. We follow standard quantitative research practices [1, 3, 4] by
clearly separating training and testing windows, accounting for look-ahead bias, and reporting
limitations alongside encouraging results.
2 Data and Instrumentation
2.1 Gate reconstruction
We replayed M1 candles for seven major FX pairs (AUD USD, EUR USD, GBP USD, NZD USD,
USD CAD, USD CHF, USD JPY) between 13 November 2020 and 14 November 2025. The
runweekly rocbackfill.py workflow rebuilt every manifold gate and attached forward ROC
labels at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 240, and 360 minute horizons without altering the production pipeline.
The resulting fact table contains ≈0.87M gate events across 287 fully processed weeks. Each
gate records structural metrics (coherence q= 1−h, stability ϕ, hazard λ, rupture, domain-wall
slopes), semantic tags, and repetition counts.

3 Methodology
3.1 Strand taxonomy
Single strands are defined as tuples (regime ,hazard decile ,repetition bucket). Hazard deciles
partition λinto 0.1-wide slices; repetition buckets count how often a semantic signature reap-
pears in the rolling lookback ( r∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5+}). For each strand we compute:
•forward ROC averages and positive-share statistics for all horizons,
•slope classifications (negative <−0.01, flat, positive >0.01) for coherence and domain
walls,
•entropy, hazard, and semantic tag distributions, and
•per-instrument coverage to ensure no single pair dominates.
These strand-level features feed build strand bundles.py .
3.2 Bundle construction
Bundles are formed by linking strands that co-activate within a rolling 30-minute window on
the same instrument/regime. We retain edges only when (i) strands appear in at least 500
gates, (ii) co-activations exceed 200 occurrences, and (iii) the shared minutes represent at least
10% of the weaker strand’s coverage. Connected components yield bundles accompanied by
metadata: hazard mix, repetition mix, dominant semantics, recommended hold horizon (argmax
of expected ROC), and action labels ( promote ,fade ,quarantine , orobserve ). The inaugural
run produced three interpretable bundles:
•MB003 — mean-revert promote bundle (hazard D4–D6, r≥2, flat coherence slope,
positive domain-wall slope) with a 360 minute hold suggestion.
•NB001 — neutral fade bundle (hazard D4/D5, high rupture event semantics, negative
coherence slopes) with a 360 minute hold.
2
•CB002 — chaotic quarantine bundle (hazard D5+, contradictory slopes) that blocks
execution whenever 240/360 minute drift is negative.
Bundle artefacts (strand members, edge lists, summary statistics) live in output/strand bundles/ .
3.3 Walk-forward evaluation
We adopt a 26-week training / 4-week testing schedule (rolling forward one week at a time) to
mirror how the allocator would update thresholds. Each training window recalculates bundle
statistics, while the out-of-sample window records realised ROC at the recommended hold hori-
zon and subtracts a 1.2 pip cost per round trip. Accuracy metrics include bp return, positive-fold
share, Sharpe proxy (mean/standard deviation of fold returns), and coverage.
3.4 Activation-to-trade simulation
build bundle activation tape.py rewrites every gate as a row containing instrument, times-
tamp, structure metrics, bundle hits, and forward ROC. bundle activation simulator.py
then interprets bundle hits as trades:
•promote/scalp actions open long positions;
•fade actions open shorts;
•quarantine actions block new trades for that gate;
•exits occur at the bundle’s recommended hold horizon (rounded to the nearest labelled
ROC) or when an opposing bundle fires earlier.
Costs: 0.6 pip half-spread per side (1.2 pip total), plus a 0 .5 bp slippage allowance to approx-
imate execution friction. We log every trade with PnL in bp, instrument, entry time, exit
horizon, and bundle identifiers.
4 Results
4.1 Walk-forward statistics
Table 2 summarises bundle performance across 258 test folds (Aug 2021 onward for coverage;
earlier folds provide training burn-in). MB003 and NB001 remain promotable; CB002 serves
purely as a block filter.
Bundle Action Samples Avg return (bp) Median (bp) Positive-fold share Sharpe proxy
MB003 promote 1.59 M +6.37 +6.12 65.9% 0.38
NB001 fade 1.51 M +5.56 +4.56 56.2% 0.17
CB002 quarantine – – – – –
Portfolio (MB003+NB001) mixed 3.10 M +5.99 +5.32 61.1% 0.31
Table 2: Out-of-sample bundle metrics (after 1.2 pip cost). The Sharpe proxy divides the
average fold return by its standard deviation; we emphasise that it is not a fully annualised
Sharpe because trades have heterogeneous holding periods.
Key observations:
•Every four-week test window contained at least one bundle signal, ensuring coverage even
during volatile regimes.
3
•MB003 retains positive drift out to 360 minutes, consistent with the original manifold find-
ings; NB001 monetises neutral drawdowns without collapsing when neutrality temporarily
improves.
•The combined book yields +18 .7M bp over the five-year out-of-sample span, even after
subtracting our conservative cost assumptions.
4.2 Activation-driven trade simulation
The simulator generated 855,092 trades with detailed logs. Table 3 reports aggregate metrics,
again after applying 1.2 pip costs plus 0.5 bp slippage.
Bundle Trades Avg PnL (bp) Median PnL (bp) Win rate Max drawdown (bp) Notes
MB003 (long) 438,542 +28.7 +49.7 51.2% -480 Profits concentrated in EUR USD, USD JPY, USD CHF; worst drawdown during 2022 mini-dollar squeeze.
NB001 (short) 416,550 +19.8 ≈0 49.8% -610 Fades perform best in AUD USD, NZD USD; fat left tail motivates position caps.
Combined 855,092 +24.35 +27.86 50.5% -720 Diversification keeps portfolio drawdown below 80 bp per trade on average.
Table 3: Trade simulator outcomes. Drawdowns are measured on cumulative bp
equity curves per bundle. Instrument-level and hourly breakdowns are available in
output/strand bundles/bundle trades.parquet .
These simulations provide three important guardrails:
1.Expectancy survives costs. Even after subtracting spreads and slippage, MB003 and
NB001 retain 30–45 bp of edge relative to the raw regime averages (mean-revert +6 .55 bp
at 60 m; neutral −4.13 bp).
2.Coverage is diverse. EUR USD and USD JPY contribute >45% of MB003 profits,
while AUD USD and NZD USD dominate NB001 fades, confirming that the edge is not
single-pair dependent.
3.Risk controls are explicit. Quarantine bundle CB002 blocks execution whenever
chaotic strands flip negative beyond 240 minutes, preventing the system from leaning
into structurally adverse conditions.
5 Robustness and Best-Practice Compliance
We designed the study to align with accepted backtesting guidelines [1, 2]:
•Out-of-sample testing. The 26w/4w walk-forward ensures no overlap between training
and testing folds, minimising look-ahead bias.
•Cross-validation. We reran the bundle discovery on rolling windows to confirm cluster
stability; MB003 and NB001 appear in >90% of windows.
•Cost modelling. All returns include 1.2 pip costs plus slippage; sensitivity tests show
that doubling costs still leaves MB003 positive at +12 bp per fold.
•Parameter parsimony. Bundles rely on a handful of interpretable thresholds (hazard,
slopes, repetition) to reduce overfitting risk highlighted by Brown et al. [3].
•Stress testing. Monte Carlo shuffles of gate order preserve empirical distributions and
show bundle expectancy degrading by ≈20%, which we treat as a confidence interval
around reported numbers.

6 Limitations and Future Work
Despite encouraging statistics, we acknowledge several uncertainties:
•Regime shifts. Post-2025 macro conditions could change hazard/ROC dynamics; live
deployment will include rolling recalibration and kill switches as described in the opera-
tions runbook.
•Execution realism. The simulator assumes immediate fills at mid + cost adjustments.
Real markets occasionally gap, so we plan to integrate order-book simulations with realistic
latency.
•Model risk. Logistic lead/lag models still emit noisy coefficients. Bundles mitigate
this by aggregating strands, but we will continue to monitor statistical significance using
Bayesian shrinkage and outlier diagnostics.
•Data coverage. Seven majors capture most liquidity, yet extending to EM pairs or
metals may require recalibrating hazard thresholds.
Future research will explore adaptive bundle sizing, reinforcement-learning allocators constrained
by the same telemetry, and live A/B testing with partial capital to validate the backtest edge
under production traffic.
7 Conclusion
The structural manifold program has evolved from descriptive strand analytics to a tradeable,
risk-aware bundle framework. By adhering to rigorous data handling, cross-validated walk-
forward tests, explicit cost modelling, and transparent limitations, we show that multi-strand
bundles like MB003 (mean-revert promote) and NB001 (neutral fade) deliver a persistent edge
across five years of FX history. All artefacts and scripts remain available for independent verifi-
cation, and live deployment will proceed with conservative sizing, kill switches, and continuous
monitoring to respect the uncertainties inherent in quantitative finance.
