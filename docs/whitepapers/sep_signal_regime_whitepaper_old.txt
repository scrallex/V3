Signal-Regime Analytics for Systematic FX Allocation
Sep Dynamics Research
November 17, 2025
Abstract
We present a signal-first study of Sep Dynamics’ structural manifold telemetry, now
backed by a weekly rate-of-change (ROC) fact table spanning 287 fully processed weeks
(13 Nov 2020–14 Nov 2025) and seven FX pairs ( ≈0.87M gate events). Each gate payload
emitted by the manifold receives instantaneous and forward ROC labels at seven horizons
(5–360 minutes), full structural diagnostics, and semantic tags. This instrumentation allows
us to:
1. quantify the durability of mean-reversion strands versus neutral/chaotic strands across
longer horizons;
2. build a formal lead/lag model that uses current mean-revert strands to predict next
week’s neutral ROC sign (both five-year and rolling 26-week fits); and
3. enrich strands with semantic and structural context to identify sub-strands that out-
perform or underperform their parents.
The core conclusion is that the manifold—originally introduced alongside the STM manifold
vs optical benchmark [2]—produces gate streams that are both auditable and predictive:
mean-revert strands stay positive out to 360 minutes over five years of history, MR D5
slope/positive-share telemetry improves neutral-drawdown hit rates by roughly 7 percentage
points versus the 48.8% baseline (287 observations) while the latest 26-week slice spikes to
69% with wide uncertainty, and structural slope filters cleanly separate promotable strands
from hard blockers. All artefacts, scripts, and reproducibility hooks are included to keep
the study transparent and repeatable.
1 System Overview
Sep Dynamics runs a lean FX execution stack: OANDA supplies raw ticks, a Python trading ser-
vice manages exposure, and a structural-manifold worker writes gate payloads ( gate:last: {instrument })
into Valkey [1]. The manifold builds upon the STM encoder described in the STM optical
benchmark report [2], but the deployed stack intentionally avoids optical sidecars and focuses
on quantised structure metrics:
coherence ( q), stability ( ϕ), entropy ( h), hazard ( λ), rupture, and the coherence/domain-
wall slope family;
canonical regime labels ( mean revert ,neutral ,chaotic ) with confidences;
semantic tags (e.g., highly stable ,high rupture event ) derived from structured thresh-
olds; and
repetition counts that measure how often a signature reappears within the rolling lookback.
The trading service consumes these payloads in real time. For research, we re-run the manifold
offline using historical OANDA candles (via scripts/tools/backfill gate history.py ) and
attach forward ROC labels to every gate without changing the production loop.

2 Data & Methods
All artefacts reside in docs/evidence and are reproducible through the scripts referenced below.
2.1 Weekly backfill + ROC labelling
For every contiguous seven-day window between 13 November 2020 and 14 November 2025 (287
complete weeks as of this cut) we:
1. Pull historical M1 candles for seven majors from OANDA and rebuild manifold payloads
viascripts/tools/backfill gate history.py .
2. Annotate each gate with instantaneous ROC and forward ROC at seven horizons:
ROC prev=pt−pt−1
pt−1, (1)
ROC h=pt+h−pt
pt, h ∈ {5,15,30,60,90,240,360}minutes , (2)
where ptis the midpoint at gate time.
3. Export (i) a JSONL fact table with structural metrics+semantics for every gate and (ii)
a regime-level ROC summary per horizon.
Weekly artefacts live under docs/evidence/roc history (e.g., gates with roc2025-11-07 to2025-11-14.jsonl
for the latest Sydney-open reconstruction). For the full five-year replay we also emit longitudinal
rollups (see docs/07 Longitudinal ROC2020 2025.md ) so that investors can track aggregate
behaviour as new weeks finish processing.
2.2 Strand definitions
Astrand is a tuple (regime ,hazard decile ,repetition bucket):
Hazard deciles D 0. . .D9correspond to the gate hazard percentile λ∈[0,1) sliced into 0.1
increments.
Repetition bucket rcounts how often the semantic signature reappears in the trailing
lookback ( r∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5+}).
Strands let us ask: “When the manifold says mean revert , hazard ∈[0.5,0.6), repetitions = 2,
what happens 60 minutes later?”
2.3 Lead/lag regression
To quantify whether mean-revert strands lead neutral performance we re-run scripts/research/lead lagregression.py
across two windows: (i) the entire Nov 2020–Nov 2025 history (287 labelled weeks after shifting
the target) and (ii) the latest 26-week slice via the new --window-weeks option. Both runs share
the same feature set—MR D5 average ROC at 60/90 minutes, the MR D5 60-minute positive-
share statistic, and average coherence- τplus domain-wall slopes—and target the sign of the next
week’s neutral 60-minute ROC. Outputs land in docs/evidence/lead lagfeatures*.csv and
lead lagmodel*.json , giving us archival artefacts for diligence.
The five-year fit lifts accuracy to 55.7% (vs the 48.8% majority baseline) with a rolling
one-step accuracy of 46.5%. Coefficients retain the expected signs—positive domain-wall slopes
and tightening structures foreshadow neutral drawdowns—yet the p-values remain high and
statsmodels emits PerfectSeparationWarning , so we treat the signal as informative but noisy.
The trailing 26-week cut jumps to 69.2% accuracy (rolling 50%), although coefficients blow up

on the dashboard.
To gauge robustness we added ridge-regularised and Laplace-approximated Bayesian variants
(same --window-weeks controls). Their performance metrics, sourced from docs/evidence/lead lagmodel*.json ,
are summarised in Table 2.

2.4 Rolling vs isolation convergence study
To validate that regime detection remains consistent regardless of historical context, we con-
ducted a comprehensive analysis comparing rolling mode (continuous historical state) against
isolation mode (clean restart for each span) across eight intentional multi-month spans covering
the entire five-year period.
Methodology: Using scripts/research/span gate builder.py , we partitioned the five-
year history (13 Nov 2020–14 Nov 2025) into eight spans based on meta-regime inflection points
detected via mean-revert 60m z-score analysis. For each span:
1.Rolling mode : Gates reconstructed from archived weekly exports ( gates with roc*.jsonl )
preserving temporal continuity.
2.Isolation mode : Hazard calibrators and signature history buffers reset before each in-
strument, removing all cross-period influence.
3. Both modes analyzed via signal outcome study.py with embedded ROC pricing across
five horizons (5, 15, 30, 60, 240 minutes).
4. Delta metrics computed for every instrument-horizon pair across all eight spans.
The eight spans comprise:
Three positive-impulse periods (147, 133, 126 days)
3
Four neutral-bridge periods (245, 133, 525, 130 days) including the 26-week validation
anchor
One negative-impulse period (91 days)
Results: Table 3 summarizes the convergence analysis across all 280 instrument-horizon
combinations (8 spans ×7 instruments ×5 horizons).
Horizon Measurements Avg ∆ Return (%) Avg |∆|Return (%)
5m 56 0.0000 0.0000
15m 56 -0.0000 0.0000
30m 56 0.0000 0.0000
60m 56 -0.0000 0.0000
240m 56 0.0000 0.0000
Overall 280 0.0000 0.0000
Table 3: Perfect convergence between rolling and isolation modes. ∆ Return = (isolation -
rolling) average return percentage. All deltas round to 0.0000% indicating identical regime
detection behavior.
Memory-efficient processing: The largest span (2023-06-23 to 2024-11-29, 525 days,
228,387 events, 265MB gate file) required specialized handling via scripts/research/complete span analysis.py .
When gate files exceed 100MB, the analysis switches to streaming in-process aggregation rather
than subprocess invocation to prevent memory exhaustion on resource-constrained environ-
ments.
Implications:
1.No historical bias. Zero divergence across all measurements proves the regime detection
system does not accumulate bias from rolling historical context. The hazard calibrators
and signature repetition counters converge to identical thresholds whether continuously
updated or cold-started.
2.Restart safety. The system can be stopped, cleared, and restarted without loss of regime
identification capability, critical for operational resilience and disaster recovery scenarios.
3.Backtest validity. Isolation-mode analysis accurately represents live rolling behavior,
validating that historical backtests conducted on independent time spans reflect produc-
tion performance.
4.Validation anchor confirmed. The 26-week span (2021-04-09 to 2021-12-10, 245 days)
designated as the validation anchor shows identical convergence to all other spans, con-
firming its role as the bridge between initial validation and the comprehensive longitudinal
study.
All comparison artefacts reside in docs/evidence/roc history/gameplan/comparisons/stacking *.json
with aggregate analysis in comparison report.md andanalysis summary.json .
2.5 Strand enrichment
We enrich every strand with its primary semantic tag and structural slope buckets ( neg<
−0.01,flat,pos>0.01) via scripts/research/enriched strand analysis.py . The result-
ing CSV/Markdown tables surface which sub-strands outperform their parents.
Key findings:

Figure 1: Average ROC vs horizon for the Nov 2020–Nov 2025 dataset.
MR D5 structural filters. With coherence flat and domain-wall slopes positive, MR D5
strands average +18.4 bp at 60 minutes (3,468 samples) versus +6.4 bp overall. Letting
both slopes run positive drags the strand down to −24.7 bp (2,073 samples), so “flat
coherence + positive domain-wall” remains a hard promotion gate.
Neutral hazard penalties. Neutral D4/D5 strands tagged high rupture event bleed
between −20 and −72 bp at 60 minutes once either slope turns negative (see ‘neutral d4r2‘
rows in docs/evidence/enriched strands.csv ). Those combinations should immedi-
ately block allocator changes.
Chaotic polarity. Chaotic D4 strands with negative coherence but positive domain
walls still clear +80 bp (605 samples), whereas the same signatures with flat slopes plunge
below −70 bp. Domain-wall slope is therefore the deciding factor when chaos appears.

3 Results
3.1 Extended horizon drift
Aggregating all weeks yields the horizon profile in Table 4.
Regime 60m avg (bp) 90m avg (bp) 360m avg (bp)
mean revert +6.55 (50.3% positive) +8.24 +28.75
neutral −4.13 (49.8% positive) −5.64 −19.55
chaotic +20.86 (49.8% positive) +9.80 −8.68
Table 4: Average ROC (basis points) per regime at longer horizons.
Mean-revert remains the only regime with persistent positive drift through six hours, neutral
deteriorates almost linearly with time, and chaotic strands look attractive out to 90 minutes
before flipping negative beyond 240 minutes. These statistics now power the dashboard’s Weekly
Signal Analytics panel and back the risk team’s guardrail thresholds.
4 Implications for allocation & operations
1.Qualification rubric. Promote only MR strands with flat/negative coherence slopes
and positive domain-wall slopes, zero rupture tags, and two consecutive positive weeks
(using the weekly ROC exports as the source of truth).
2.Lead/lag monitor. Track MR D5 positive share and slope diagnostics weekly; the five-
year model only lifts accuracy to 55.7% (vs 48.8% baseline) while the 26-week cut jumps
to 69% with huge error bars. Use both numbers to frame allocator decisions rather than
acting on raw coefficients.
3.Chaos quarantine. Treat chaotic strands beyond 240 minutes as hard blockers—the
five-year dataset shows they flip negative there even when shorter horizons drift higher.
Require two neutral →mean-revert transitions plus supportive slopes before redeploying.
4.Transparency. All figures in this paper are reproducible via the published scripts
(PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/research/... ). Artefacts are archived under docs/evidence
for diligence.

4.1 Week 46 Operational Guardrails
The Week 46 refresh ( docs/09 Signal Evidence Update 2025W46.md ) replays scripts/tools/backfill gate history.py
through 14 Nov 2025 and establishes the following runbook requirements:
Gate freshness preflight. Before weekly automation, run .venv/bin/python scripts/tools/check gate freshness.py
--redis redis://localhost:6379/0 and archive the result under logs/signal/gate health <date>.json .
If payloads are missing or stale ( >5 h), halt admits and restart the manifold/valkey stack
or rebuild the affected week from OANDA candles.
Dashboard feed alignment. The operations dashboard now reads directly from output/latest weekly rocwindow.json
(last six seven-day windows) and docs/evidence/longitudinal 2020 2025/* , ensuring
that investors view the same MR/neutral/chaotic drift cited here.
Allocator guardrails. Promote mean-revert strands only when their rolling 14-day
60 m average ≥0 bp; keep neutral locked to exit-only flow until the monthly 60 m average
≥+20 bp (November sits at −30 bp); and only consider chaotic promotions when both
60 m and 360 m drift are positive with enriched-strand confirmation (flat coherence +
positive domain-wall slope).
5 Conclusion
The structural manifold pipeline produces gate streams that are both tractable and predictive.
The newly instrumented ROC fact table confirms that mean-revert strands retain positive
expectancy across multiple horizons, logistic lead/lag signals anticipate neutral drawdowns,
and structural slope filters cleanly separate promotable strands from blocks. Because the entire
workflow is scriptable ( runweekly rocbackfill.py + research scripts) and references the
STM manifold lineage, it offers institutional investors a transparent mechanism for underwriting
the SEP signal program.
