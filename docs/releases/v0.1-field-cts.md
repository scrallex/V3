# v0.1-field-cts Release Notes

## Highlights
- Freeze methodology for the binary-field CTS runner: tie-drop majority kernels, first-eight-phase averaging, deterministic seeds/grids, and explicit clamped/periodic boundary coverage.
- Publish six reproducible figures (perturbation split, radius sweep, lag sweep, compressibility, domain walls, spectra) with bootstrap CIs and boundary ablation.
- Export new gate-facing metrics – `coherence_tau_slope`, `domain_wall_slope`, and `spectral_lowf_share` – now parsed by the trading stack so contractive vs expansive regimes show up in live guardrails.

## Artefacts
- CUDA sweeps + analysis JSON: `apps/field_cts/output/analysis/`
- Figures (camera-ready PNG): `apps/field_cts/output/figures/figure{1..6}.png`
- Experiment manifest: `apps/field_cts/output/params.json`
- Reproduction checklist: `apps/field_cts/REPRO.md`

## How to Reproduce
1. `make -C apps/field_cts runner`
2. `python apps/field_cts/scripts/run_sweeps.py`
3. `python apps/field_cts/scripts/plot_figures.py`
4. Archive `apps/field_cts/output/` plus this release note alongside any submission bundle.

## Integration Hooks
- Strategy guard thresholds for the new metrics live in `config/echo_strategy.yaml`.
- `TradingService.gate_metrics()` surfaces the fresh slopes/shares so dashboards and alerts can track them without unpacking the raw payload.
- Reference scoring stencil:  
  `score = (-coherence_tau_slope) + (-domain_wall_slope) + spectral_lowf_share + temporal_MI`
