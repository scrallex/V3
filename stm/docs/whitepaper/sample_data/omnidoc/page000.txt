OmniDoc sample transcript describing a synthetic benchmark page used to validate the manifold
compression pipeline. It mirrors the format expected by OmniDocBench with headings, paragraphs,
numeric references, and short bullet-style sentences that challenge the structural encoder.

Section 1 introduces the dataset assumptions and lists the instrumentation required to reproduce
benchmarks. Section 2 enumerates the sliding window parameters: window_bytes = 256, stride_bytes = 192,
precision = 2. Section 3 discusses evaluation criteria, including compression ratio, recall, precision,
and false-positive rate.

The closing paragraphs revisit the motivation for structural signatures in lieu of optical tokens. The
goal is to demonstrate that repetition counts and hazard thresholds allow us to validate page content
without retaining the full textual payload. This mirrors the "optical compression" narrative but grounds
it entirely in SEP's manifold mapping technique.
